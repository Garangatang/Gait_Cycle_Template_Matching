# Gait_Cycle_Template_Matching

## What is it

A Python pipeline to manually mark a subsection of underfoot pressure data which can then be used to parse much larger datasets from a constructed template.

## Features

Manual_Inflection_Point_Marking_GUI: Graphical User Interface (GUI) which can be used to manually mark a subsection of inflection points to be used in constructing a template.

Gait_Cycle_Template_Matching: Constructs a template from the subsection of manually marked inflection points that can be used to find all inflection points in a large underfoot pressure dataset.

## Instructions

For any usage cite the paper on ieeexplore [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/11063134/references#references).

gc_template_matching.yml contains the anaconda environment used to run both files. Load this environment into anaconda and use it through your favorite coding environment. For usage details, read the description at the top of each Python file. 

## Updates
A fully automated v2 version will be linked here after testing has been completed. The v2 version will require no manual marking of data.
